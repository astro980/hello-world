# hello-world


Hey There!

It's astro980 here, I'm a versatile type of a guy. I like working on computer and electronics stuff. I studied I.T(Information of Technology) at Philippines untill me and my family moved to Canada. Pretty life here in Canada are Ups and Downs. I do like programming code but I loved to play Dota 2 and working with PC. My wish someday is to build a high-end gaming rig hopefully someday. I'm married with my beautiful wife and handsome son. I currently employeed with the SeedMaster Manufacturing. Imagine a geek guy like me that's love to fix, code and assemble computer, is currently working with connecting hydraulics lines, wiring, reading schematics, and etc.(like a mechanic can do).
